# budget-app
A spanish budget app page created while learning JS with a FreeCodeCamp course.
These are the functions for the app:
- Registers the incomes and expenses.
- Creates a list of the expenses which you can edit or delete any of them individually.
- Calculates the balance between the incomes and expenses.
- Presents every one of these data in an organized way on the right side.
